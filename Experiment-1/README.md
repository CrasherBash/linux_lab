# Experiment: Installing and Running a Linux Virtual Machine

## Aim
To install and run a Linux virtual machine using virtualization software and verify its successful booting.

## Objective
* To understand the concept of virtualization.
* To learn how to import and run an OVA file.
* To verify the proper working of a Linux virtual machine.

## Theory

### About Virtualization


Virtualization is a technology that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine using software like Oracle VirtualBox or VMware Workstation. An OVA (Open Virtual Appliance) file contains a pre-configured virtual machine with an operating system and required settings. By importing this file into virtualization software, a complete system can be set up quickly without manual installation.

## Step-by-step Procedure: Installing Linux Using VMware

1. **First, VMware Workstation was installed.**
2. **Then, the application was launched.**
3. **After that, "Open a Virtual Machine" was selected.**
4. **Then, the OVA file was browsed and selected.**
5. **After that, the appliance was imported and converted.**
6. **Then, hardware settings were reviewed.**
7. **After that, the virtual machine was powered on.**
8. **Finally, login was done and proper booting was verified.**

## Results
* Virtual machine imported successfully.
* Linux operating system booted without errors.
* System responded properly to commands.
