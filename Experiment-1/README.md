How i installed linux Using Oracle VirtualBox

I downloaded and installed Oracle VirtualBox from the official website.

I opened the VirtualBox Manager.

I clicked on File → Import Appliance.

I selected the provided Linux OVA file.

I reviewed the VM settings like RAM, CPU, and storage.

I clicked Import to create the virtual machine.

I started the virtual machine.

I logged in and verified that Linux booted successfully.
